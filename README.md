Project description: This demonstration illustrates the process of solving a time-dependent partial differential equation using a variational algorithm and Hamiltonian evolution. Unlike other quantum differential equation solver algorithms that use the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations (HHL), this example is based on the work of Fong Yew Leong, Wei-Bin Ewe, and Dax Enshan Koh, published on June 25, 2022, in the following reference: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14906-3].
